# My Beyond Mod 0 Plan!

Now that we are nearing the end of our mod 0 journey, I would like to take a moment to reflect on what was really working and what was not working so I am successful going into Mod 1.

First, I’ll begin with what didn’t work and needs to be improved upon. 

I think the biggest concern to my work ethic is making sure I’m in a productive struggle and not an unproductive struggle.  I’m serial for saying to myself, “you can take a break when you finish this assignment” or “you can eat after you finish this assignment” which only sends me into a deeper struggle the longer it takes. I need to realize when  not thinking straight so I can be productive in my struggle. What also my help with this is actually sticking to my scheduled times for working and eating. If I notice that my schedule says break or lunch and I’m still working, then I need to stop. If I don’t stop, then I just end up creating more issues or not gaining any progress on the assignment I’m working on.

Also, I need to not let the workload envelope my entire life. I should be setting time aside to unwind with my family and friends or just take time to turn off the computer and shut off that part of my brain. I get anxious when I have outstanding tasks, and I need to calm down and tell myself, “It’s not the end of the world” 

One more thing is just increasing my quality of life and not doing the bare minimum when it comes to my health. I put in the extra effort and work hard for assignments, but I can’t say the same for way I treat my body.

Now, I’ll talk about what works.

I think what’s currently working is my setup and sitting at the computer for long periods of time without burnout. I feel that I’m more fortunate when it comes to this, because I had 2 remote jobs in tech prior to joining Turing. I have the monitors, keyboard, mouse, big desk with space for whatever I need. I’ve also been extremely into competitive video games most of my life, so I would play all day to achieve high ranks. Over the course of a few years my body has gotten so used to sitting at the computer and engaging with whatever’s happening on the screen that it’s hard for me to not be engaged unless previously mentioned that I’m experiencing burnout due to hunger.

Now that we’ve gone over what works and what doesn’t work. Let’s create a plan for mod 0 so I’m successful.

Step 1: is to make sure that I’m adding ANY and EVERYTHING to my calendar and to follow it as much as possible not just jumping around everywhere being unorganized. If I need extra time on an assignment I should be adding that to my calendar, This should help with organization and time management. If someone needs my help or I need help I then know what time I have free based on my schedule, not just winging it for whatever time works.

Step 2: Self care. Going back to the conversation with Danae. I realized I don’t take care of myself as much as I should. For example, sleeping in and skipping a morning shower. Instead I should go to bed earlier and plan out time so I’m refreshed and ready to go in the morning. Another thing in self care is food. I wait so long to eat until I finish what I’m doing, I need to set a scheduled time where I eat and stick to it. If I’m in the middle of something and the lunch notification hits. I need to take 2 minutes to wrap up and then go eat. Another thing I will add in here as well is a deep clean of my desk and living space. I don’t do this regularly, but I did do it recently and even though I did it recently, my desk is already a mess. So maybe staying on top of cleanliness in my area as well.

Step 3: Keeping in touch with my classmates and small group especially. We’re all experiencing some of the same struggles and speaking with each other can provide help or guidance on how to deal with those issues. Like Kaitlyn said, this will be our network going forward, so building these interpersonal relationships can go a long way.

So far this is my plan for going into Mod 0. I’m sure there are other small things that I should include, but for the most part I feel that tacking these will go a long way in my development.
